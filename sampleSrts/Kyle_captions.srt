something that I

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,090
I've always believed in something that
I've really always in some way shape or

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,050
to real estate and then I sell cattle

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,539
and the rain production sale any money
mine

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,910
the auction industry is something that
I've always believed and I think that as

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,670
our chinny years is our duty to

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,770
to train the next generation we're in
this together

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,010
got a lot of competitors this business
we all do is watch years

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,510
I also got a lot of friends and I think
that's something that

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,159
that we really bring the forefront here
Westergaard functionaries

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,799
we we are able to show students what
it's like to be in this business to be

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,610
professional

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,450
and giving back to the industry
something that

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,840
did I guess I've always believed in this
is my way up

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,390
doing a small portion their introducing
new auctioneers

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,520
into this business that child's here

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,740
the topics that are covered include have
been calling

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,960
I in technology with regard to
technology in its ever-changing

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,290
we as auctioneers need to be on the
cutting edge in that I feel an offer

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,610
that to our customers

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,510
not not only the buyers but the seller's
that we work with and I think that is

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,480
the curriculum that we can give them
here

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,850
give these young auctioneers here the
BCA will help them step right into them

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,740
when they head out

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,310
on their own and margins with that said
in all the

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,430
technology it live simulcast options and
internet only options that will even

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,170
talk about

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,100
there still a big need for bid callers
and will spend a lot of time talking

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,840
about

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,149
how to construct a chance how to build a
foundation is based on clarity

42
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,970
based on those numbers that we that we
drill on hammer on

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,820
when you leave here you will have the
Foundation's up having a chance of a

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,590
champion

45
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,040
teaching here Westergaard auctioneering
his given me an opportunity

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,190
to give back to a profession that I
believe very strongly in something like

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,840
grew up and have a passion for

48
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,500
and I loves bringing a new students into

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,530
the auction business and helping them
find their place in it

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,970
we look around the the auction community
we see competitor

51
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,959
more more matter we see for years and i
think thats

52
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,180
the beginning along those relationships
right here at auction school

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,600
when we can

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,730
help the young next-generation
auctioneers head right

55
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,710
head first in the industry Western
graduate has a certain existing

56
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,520
said go around the country you'll
typically here

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,350
be able to pick up where auctioneer from
by the sound of their chair

58
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,140
I believe that you can pick out a
Western graduate

59
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,360
in about any crowd they have a distinct
rhythm about them

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,090
and as sting clarity which is is one of
the most important thing

61
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,580
we do is on its bid callers you is

62
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,950
convey the price they were asking for if
they can understand

63
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,080
I'll were on a job and I think the
clarity and

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,200
and the rhythm latest hot here is
certainly evident

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
in those dues to go out he's comes said

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,860
the quality construction here
Westergaard functionary in my opinion

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,710
is second to none first of all the the
instructors are all successful

68
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,430
auctioneers

69
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,220
voice specialist cells full time in the
industry in some capacity

70
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,200
the comparable wide spectrum of
different segments of the industry from

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,580
livestock auction years to real estate
benefit auction

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,790
specialists to personal property
auctioneers

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,510
agricultural equipment auctioneer so a
student here really gets

74
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,700
to see everything that this auction
industry

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,660
has ended

76
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,730
my favorite part about being an
auctioneer's is the business

77
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,940
everything that we teach your with
regard to communication dealing with

78
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,620
people in

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,560
and of course the bid call it's all my
favorite there's nothing to compare to

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
stand and sit behind the microphone

81
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,739
working on behalf of the Seller selling
their assets and

82
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,300
and rush that comes from that and

83
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,350
the ability to help people naturally
what I thrive on old

84
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,720
the limit a class size here allows me
and the other instructors

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,500
time for individual training everybody's
got different needs

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,010
with regard to the bid call with regard
to the business everybody is in a

87
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,850
different spot

88
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,290
and with the smaller class size it
allows us to

89
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,860
assist each one of those students and
get to where they need to go

90
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,620
every day we had a new level with
technology and

91
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,639
in SD the influence that has had on the
auction industry is no different as

92
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
having a lot of other industries

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,810
but this industry is headed up and
there's a lot of opportunities that have

94
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,660
opened up to auctioneers in the last
several years that weren't there years

95
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,130
ago

96
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,570
internet only auctions different ways to
market our product and our services

97
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,280
on the Internet a this is a is a great
time to get the business because

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,750
right now there is so much more in our
fingertips than ever before

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,539
there still a need for good

100
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,090
bit taller but there's a lot of other
things that can be incorporated into an

101
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,789
auction business the killer in here

102
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,840
I found my chance from the foundation

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,060
that's based on your WC a and then
listening to a lot of other auctioneers

104
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,650
most on WC graduates and everybody all
know

105
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,710
everybody will develop their own style
as time goes on

106
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,430
and in that style really is starting
right here an auction school

107
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,970
when you go out into the business you
start conducting real live auctions

108
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,039
that style only role in only develop
over time

109
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,440
and eventually you'll be a master 0

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,690
me
