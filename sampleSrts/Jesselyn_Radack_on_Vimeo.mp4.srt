2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,500
 Don't like to put those guys were some words

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,400
words I know the media is quick to

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
do you don't know how whistle blowing

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,900
is gas and such a dirty

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,700
need of

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,600
being people who are out for the

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,700
more profit or revenge.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,400
Because all that was somewhere as

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,400
I've worked with have

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,800
been regular people.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,900
I wouldn't describe them as shrinking violets.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,800
They're usually outspoken

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,700
people

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
who have a good sense of who they are

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,700
and their place

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,700
in an organization and the limits

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,500
of what an organization can

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,600
and should be doing.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,000
I think every person in themselves

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
has a squeel point of

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
something where it's the they

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
can no longer endure

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
witnessing it

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,100
now.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
I mean on a very basic level

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
if you see an old lady being mugged.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
You probably dial

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,000
9 1 1 on your cell phone and

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
make a police report.

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,800
Well that's what some lying.

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,800
In my office in the ethics office we

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
took turns being the duty attorney

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for the day and it was

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
just random that

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,300
I happened to be the ethics

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,300
officer on desk.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,500
Win I got a call from

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,100
the criminal division

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,500
of the same Justice

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,400
Department saying that

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,200
the FBI was on the ground

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
and wanted to interrogate

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
an American who is being

45
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,800
called the American

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Taliban it was all over the news and

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,900
wanted to interrogate him.

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,200
And I was told matter of fact

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,600
that he had a lawyer.

50
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,300
So in accordance with the advice

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,600
we always give in this kind of situation

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,500
and

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I said you can't do that

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
he's an American.

55
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,900
He's represented by counsel.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
But here are some other ways you can properly

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
be able to do that.

58
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,200
You could do an undercover.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh you could try to get a waiver

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I mean there are different that

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
you could probably do this

62
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
in different alternatives to

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,000
try to talk to him.

64
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,900
And that was on a Friday.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
So the advice

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
I gave was not unique.

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Really.

68
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,800
That case happened to be a high profile

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
one but this was what

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,700
I would normally give to any department

71
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,900
attorney who had an agent

72
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,800
on the ground who wanted to do something.

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,500
And this person

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,700
who called me called back on

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,100
Monday two days later

76
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,900
saying well they

77
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,800
interrogated him anyway despite

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,100
your advice the

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
FBI interrogated the

80
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,100
American Taliban

81
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,300
John Walker Lindh.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,100
What shall we do now and again

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
I said don't panic.

84
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
I mean this happens that people disregard

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,900
our advice.

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,300
They make an ethical blunder and we

87
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,700
need to help try to fix it so

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
I said look you can seal

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
that interview and you can use it for

90
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,000
national security and intelligence

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
gathering purposes but not

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
for criminal prosecution.

93
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
And they seemed fine with that

94
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,300
answer.

95
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
And when they were going to communicate that

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,300
to the military

97
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,100
on the ground and the

98
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,900
FBI agent

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
who had interrogated him.

100
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Then sometime

101
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
you know maybe a month or so later

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,100
John Ashcroft who was the attorney

103
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
general at the time

104
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,500
he was very fond of these very dramatic

105
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,400
press conferences and he gave way

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,700
in announcing

107
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,600
that they were

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,900
going to charge

109
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
John Walker Lindh.

110
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,600
And a reporter

111
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,100
said

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
I heard he had a lawyer.

113
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,600
Was he able to have his lawyer

114
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,100
with them.

115
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
And Ashcroft said if we knew

116
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
that he was represented by counsel

117
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
he would be allowed to meet with that lawyer.

118
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,200
And I knew there was a flat out lie.

119
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,300
But again he was the attorney general so

120
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
it was his prerogative to say what he wanted.

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
And I kept my mouth shut.

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then a couple of weeks later he

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
had another press conference

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
on the same topic.

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,300
And by this point

126
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
there were pictures circulating

127
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,200
around the world of

128
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,300
John Walker Lindh naked

129
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,800
blindfolded bound to a board

130
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,800
gagged with a butt that's written all

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,900
over his head is for head.

132
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,300
And

133
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,400
it looked very reminiscent

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,300
of what we've later would see

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,100
at Abu Ghraib.

136
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
It was clear that he was being

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,200
tortured.

138
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,000
And so a reporter asked.

139
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,900
It looks like this guy is being tortured

140
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,900
what's going on.

141
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
And again the attorney general said

142
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,300
that his rights had been carefully

143
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,400
scrupulously guarded.

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,500
Again I knew that was a complete lie

145
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,400
because they actually commit an

146
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,300
ethics violation and it

147
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
sure didn't look like he was

148
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,300
being treated very well.

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
But again I kept my mouth shut

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and they

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,900
filed a criminal case against

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,600
him which I had advised them

153
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,900
not to do that they did the exact

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,500
opposite.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Good thing they're.

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Bothering Me. As the case progresses

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,500
swears that

158
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,300
it all came down to

159
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
a suppression hearing that

160
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,300
he was going to have the crux of the case

161
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,000
was his confession during his interrogation.

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
The one I hit advised against.

163
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,600
And on

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
March 7th.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,900
That was a pivotal day for me.

166
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,500
Because the prosecutor himself

167
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
e-mailed me and said

168
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
as you know there is a federal court

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
discovery order for all

170
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,100
Justice Department correspondence related

171
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,300
to John Walker and women's interrogation

172
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,500
I have two of your e-mails and

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,400
I wanted to make sure

174
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I have everything.

175
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,600
And at that point

176
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,900
I was a laureate because

177
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,100
I knew I had written

178
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,900
WAY more than two e-mails but

179
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
I was still

180
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
naive about it and

181
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,700
I went up and checked the

182
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
hard copy file.

183
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,400
And that's when my heart really sank.

184
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
I checked the file

185
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,700
and it was empty except

186
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,600
for two very innocuous pieces of

187
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
paper and it had been about an inch

188
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,900
thick.

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
And at that point

190
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
I felt like okay something

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
really bad is going on.

192
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,700
So I consulted with a senior

193
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,000
attorney who had been a

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,700
U.S. attorney for seven years.

195
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,700
And I sat quite

196
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
aware what's going on here.

197
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
And he just told me you know he

198
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,100
looked through the file and said very matter

199
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
of fact we this file has been

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
purged and

201
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
I'm like why is that.

202
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
It completely threw me for

203
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
a loop because we were simultaneously

204
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
prosecuting their interests

205
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,100
in Enron for destruction of evidence

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
and obstruction of justice and the idea

207
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
that the department could actually

208
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,800
get rid of evidence

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
in violation of a court order no

210
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,400
laugh.

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,100
Was unthinkable to me.

212
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,500
At that point

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
I confronted my boss.

214
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
She came in and

215
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,100
I said Claudia

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
there's a discovery order

217
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,400
and no one told me about it

218
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,700
and apparently it has not been

219
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,900
complied with because a prosecutor

220
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,400
only has to have my e-mails

221
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,300
and she just glared at me

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,500
and said very matter of fact

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
I sent everything

224
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,000
that was in the file.

225
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,800
And at

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
that point now she's connecting

227
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
herself to

228
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
death. I mean she is admitting that she

229
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,500
is involved in the

230
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
Senate have handled the file.

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,300
And

232
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
I just said that I wrote more e-mails than

233
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,200
that.

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
And I didn't quite know what to do

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,700
but I knew I didn't want to be a part of us.

236
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,900
I called my husband because he was a

237
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,600
contractor at the time and

238
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
I was like look something really

239
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
really really unseemly is going

240
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,300
on here and

241
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,100
you need to get a perm a permanent

242
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
position because

243
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
I think I'm going to resign.

244
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It's that bad like

245
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,100
I don't want to be a part of this

246
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,600
now.

247
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,100
I mean it's if your monumental to me

248
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,600
and

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I called up technical

250
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
support this is early in the digital

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,700
age in its infancy at that apartment.

252
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,100
And I said look

253
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,800
I had all these emails.

254
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
You know put them in the trash and

255
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,600
empty my trash on the

256
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
computer and they do read

257
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
off the computer every

258
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,300
30 days so

259
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
I probably can't get them back.

260
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,300
Great.

261
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,000
And they're like oh you know we can get them back nothing

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,100
disappears and we spent

263
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
hours going through these different ballet

264
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
steps to try to recover

265
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,000
them. Then I was able to recover.

266
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
About a dozen e-mails of

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,500
I know I've written more than

268
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,800
a dozen that had

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
their documentation and that the

270
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,400
FBI had screwed up and

271
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,300
committed an ethics violation in

272
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
its interrogation of

273
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,400
John Walker Lindh.

274
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
So I documented the two pieces

275
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,700
of paper in the file and they put in

276
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
order all of the other e-mails

277
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
and essentially like a bull and about what

278
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,700
they are an attached

279
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,600
Cubbie is word a memo to my

280
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
boss to

281
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
document that and then a

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,900
Xerox copy of it to take

283
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,100
home with me in case the emails

284
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,300
disappeared again

285
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
and I

286
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,600
took it to my bath

287
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,700
and she seemed

288
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,000
in a fury that

289
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I had done it.

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,000
She's like why wouldn't you send the file.

291
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
It's kind of like you

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
tell me how do you know why weren't they in the file

293
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,100
and

294
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,300
I said you know where

295
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,300
I am not even going to be a part of

296
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
whatever game

297
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
you're running here.

298
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
I am resigning

299
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
you have two weeks my two weeks notice in

300
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,100
resigning.

301
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,100
I got a job in another

302
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,400
at a law firm a private law firm.

303
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
Doing something totally unrelated to

304
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
anything I was trained and

305
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,700
I was doing affordable housing law but

306
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I thought OK socially redeeming

307
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
work and a bigger paycheque.

308
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
But I continued on the radio

309
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
to hear things about the

310
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,800
John Walker Lindh criminal case as

311
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
it was progressing

312
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
and the things

313
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,800
I was hearing on the radio said to

314
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,300
me

315
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
oh John Walker

316
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Lindh never had told full

317
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
steam and oh here's raids

318
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,400
were by the book

319
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
followed things

320
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I knew were partly untrue and that

321
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
told me if my e-mail said and backed

322
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
me to the judge

323
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
I would think that a person would have the temerity

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,900
to be making statements like that

325
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,400
in a weighed very heavily on me

326
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,500
I mean I was a raging insomniac.

327
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,200
I could not fully say

328
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,700
it was I mean the guy had

329
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,800
like three life counts on and

330
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,800
it was a feeling of like you

331
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
me and someone could be put to death

332
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,100
because I

333
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
I kept my mouth shut

334
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,700
and that

335
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
is a really for

336
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,000
me that's the line

337
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,900
I mean that's something

338
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,400
I can live with for me.

339
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,100
So.

340
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
You know my moments.

341
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
One morning I heard my guests a couple of

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
then of Newsweek saying

343
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
that oh we never had a council that's

344
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,300
not an issue and

345
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,100
I called Make a scarf and

346
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
I said I don't know who's tell

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
you beforehand of bullshit but

348
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,900
I have evidence to prove that it's run.

349
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Before that I had gone to the judge

350
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
to try to give him the e-mails but

351
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
I no longer worked at the department and

352
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,100
I was told by his clerks

353
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,400
I no longer had standing

354
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
by the hand I am I called

355
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Mike

356
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,500
I was just like you keep saying

357
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
this and I showed him the e-mails

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,900
and he said he would write an article

359
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
on it which

360
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,300
he did.

361
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
He asked if I wanted to be named

362
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
in the article which

363
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,000
I did not act.

364
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,900
He wanted to be anonymous.

365
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,500
So he wrote a really good article that actually

366
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
endevour causing

367
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
the ultimate collapse of

368
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,100
the John Walker Lindh kith

369
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,300
But meanwhile

370
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,500
Newsweek put up all of my e-mails

371
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
with my name on

372
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,300
their new Web site.

373
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,100
So it was like a big red arrow pointing

374
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,000
right at me and

375
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,500
I.

376
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,800
So that really.

377
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
Indeed I think by blowing

378
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,600
the whistle I thought it

379
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,500
was over with like

380
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:53,900
OK

381
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I've done my part.

382
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
I can fully began

383
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
I can live with myself and whatever

384
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,600
happens happens.

385
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,900
But I didn't realize

386
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,000
I just unleashed the full force

387
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,100
of the entire executive branch

388
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
and they came in they saw my new law firm

389
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
that I was a criminal that

390
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I would steal new files create

391
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,600
files protected

392
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
files and that they should fire me.

393
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,800
They leaned on a private law firm to

394
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
fire me which the law firm wouldn't

395
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,900
deal but they put me on this weird

396
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,900
administrative unpeel

397
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
indefinite in the mistreated weave.

398
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,100
And

399
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
it was like being in purgatory.

400
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Meanwhile you

401
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
know they're just describe how can

402
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,100
I hire a lawyer and the

403
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,400
Justice Department starts making noises

404
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,300
about a criminal investigation

405
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,800
and that they were putting me under criminal investigation.

406
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
For a forum leaking

407
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
which is the first criminal

408
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,500
investigation

409
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,200
I know of since maybe

410
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,100
Ellsberg says.

411
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,600
For someone who did and revealed not

412
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
by non-scientific.

413
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,300
I

414
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
had done a research memo it during my time

415
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,600
working in the ethics office

416
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,300
I was a world production loss so

417
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,800
I knew what they said and

418
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
I knew that

419
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,900
going to the media was an

420
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,800
option and going to

421
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
Congress was an option.

422
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,900
I'd already been to my superior

423
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,100
and to the prosecutor saying something

424
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,300
fishy is going on.

425
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,500
I knew that I had you

426
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,700
know I met the standard

427
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
I had a reasonable belief

428
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,700
that what I was witnessing evidenced

429
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,600
fraud waste abuse or illegality

430
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,100
or a danger to public health and safety

431
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,300
and so within

432
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,500
that understanding

433
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I blew the whiff of wet

434
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
down upon me was that there was a blur

435
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,900
Protection Act is a paper

436
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
tiger it has no enforcement

437
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,500
mechanism.

438
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
So when the government starts retaliating

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
against you and big with

440
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
there's really nothing you can

441
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,400
do to make it stop.

442
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,700
And the retaliation

443
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
began with them trying to get me fired

444
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,900
from my law firm the law firm

445
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,100
being you know playing

446
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,000
both sides of the street cooperating

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,700
with the government yet at the same time

448
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
claiming I still work there and not

449
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
letting me do any work.

450
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,200
And

451
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,800
then you petty

452
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,700
little things like that a lot.

453
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I mean the guy the government actually

454
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
helped the law firm.

455
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
I. Can test my receipt

456
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,700
of my meagre pathetic unemployment

457
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
benefits which

458
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,200
I was entitled to because

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,900
I was no longer getting an income.

460
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
So I filed for an insurance

461
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
and there was pretty

462
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,700
humiliating for me.

463
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
But really you're going to can test my you

464
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
know big 300 bucks a week

465
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,200
I get to buy gas and groceries

466
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,200
that Peddie though and

467
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
as soon as one thing and another would

468
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
be again so finally once a criminal

469
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,400
case and did on

470
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
September

471
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
11. Ironically

472
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
of 2003 it ended

473
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
with no charges being brought

474
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,400
but within days with the department

475
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,300
had referred me to the state birds of which

476
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm licenced as an attorney in both

477
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Maryland and D.C.

478
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,300
So no I had to fight on another front

479
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
and all of these fights cost a lot

480
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
of money because

481
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
I had a private attorney was billing

482
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,500
at a very high rate

483
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
upwards of a thousand dollars.

484
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,100
Then I had to have another attorney an employment

485
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
attorney dealing with the law firm

486
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,600
which was giving me grief which

487
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
kept claiming I was still employed there but

488
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,900
was not paying me

489
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,500
for.

490
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
So if it did it was a mess

491
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,400
and the bar referrals.

492
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
There was a whole other attorney

493
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,600
I needed for that to deal

494
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,700
with the DC and

495
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Maryland borrowers

496
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,600
A.

497
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,100
The complaint against me in

498
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
D.C. lasted until this path

499
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,800
no

500
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
10 years before a guard dismissed

501
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
and that was only because two of the

502
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,300
major players died.

503
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
And then also during that time

504
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I found that I was on the no

505
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
fly list on full equity

506
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,700
portion of the no fly list meaning

507
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
you get hassled and have to undergo

508
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
secondary security screening every

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,900
time you fly.

510
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,900
Again that was just in inconvenience

511
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,800
and a way to intimidate and

512
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,400
her wrath and delay

513
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,300
and mess with you.

514
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,400
Basically the government has

515
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,200
a meaning in just

516
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
a whole panoply

517
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
of things it can do to screw

518
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
with the full purse.

519
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,900
LINDH endevour pleading guilty

520
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,800
in a surprise plea bargain

521
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
deal on the eve of the

522
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,200
suppression hearing that was going to

523
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,100
bring OUT IN THE OPEN who did what to

524
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
whom and who broke

525
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,000
what rules the stuff that

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,100
I would boast about.

527
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
So it collapsed he pled guilty

528
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,300
to two minor and ministry of infractions

529
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,000
and was.

530
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
Over punished with

531
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,100
20 years in jail.

532
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
So here again I thought OK end of my ordeal but my ordeal continued for

533
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,300
another.

534
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,200
Three or four years.

535
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
And at that point I decided

536
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,000
I was going to dedicate my life to representing

537
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,400
whistleblowers.

538
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,100
Because clearly they were

539
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
a group that did not have the protection

540
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,400
that they needed.

541
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,500
I mean my personal experiences

542
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
and in

543
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,500
the same time meeting if you are there

544
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
with blowers who were going through similar

545
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,300
things and thinking.

546
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
OK I want to do this kind of work

547
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,900
because for better or for worse

548
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
I've learned it by going very

549
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,300
well. I've gone through.

550
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
I've learned was soberer law

551
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,600
so I ended up working for

552
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
Alan Grayson who is

553
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,400
Congressman now but at the time

554
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
working at his firm little

555
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
Rep.. Going after

556
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,800
the people who were blowing the

557
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
whistle on reconstruction fraud

558
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
in Eye rack and

559
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
I did that for two years

560
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
so that was sort of poetic justice

561
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,800
if and then.

562
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
I mean I was elected to the

563
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,800
D.C. bar and legal ethics committee

564
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
so that was more just

565
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,900
ahead of me does

566
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,500
it. No legal ethics there

567
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,600
I understand it that elected

568
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,700
that board and then

569
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,500
an opening.

570
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Alan Garber elected to

571
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,500
Congress an eye

572
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,900
opening occurred

573
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,300
at the Government Accountability

574
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,900
Project to head up a new

575
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,600
national security human

576
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,400
rights program which

577
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,300
was an ideal fit for what

578
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,800
I was doing

579
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,900
I was doing pro bono work

580
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,700
on behalf of clients on a merger

581
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
news and writing articles about legal

582
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
ethics and

583
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,800
how it meshes with the war on terrorism.

584
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
So it was great again.

585
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,600
But I thought

586
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,700
I would be dealing more with kind of the bread

587
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,000
and butter whistleblower cases

588
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
where people get

589
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
to move to the war they've been

590
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,900
you know that they've had their security

591
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
clearance Paul door

592
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,900
and you know it worst maybe

593
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,000
they've been fired.

594
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,400
And there were a number of cases

595
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
I didn't like that at first

596
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,700
but then

597
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,300
I read about this guy

598
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,600
Thomas Drake and

599
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,300
everything I read described

600
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,600
him a behaviour as a whistleblower.

601
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
It described exactly what

602
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
I was familiar with do you

603
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,100
any good and

604
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,700
I did.

605
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,000
And at that point no new we had crossed the

606
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Rubicon into

607
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
a new age.

608
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,200
If we were going to criminally prosecute

609
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,700
whistleblowers and do so for espionage

610
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,900
a law meant to go after spies

611
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,100
not with the blowers

612
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
and so my practice

613
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,700
has developed

614
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,600
into you representing

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
unfortunately a long list of people

616
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
right now who've been charged who

617
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
have been investigated

618
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,300
or charged under

619
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,000
the Espionage Act.

620
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,600
The Espionage

621
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,100
Act is this long into quid

622
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,000
overbroad extremely

623
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,300
The fact

624
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,600
that

625
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,700
I mean when it was written in

626
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,200
1917

627
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,400
it even though that's

628
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
decades before the word classified

629
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
even into the lexicon.

630
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
So they're talking about war materials

631
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
and designs

632
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
and films and

633
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,100
you know it was completely.

634
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,900
Antiquated but really it was meant to go

635
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,000
after spies and

636
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
not people

637
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
who were trying to do the right thing so

638
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
the fact that that was being used was a very

639
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,600
heavy handed and very dangerous.

640
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,300
Certainly concerned me

641
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,900
and I definitely worried about the fact

642
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,800
that this happened to

643
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,000
Tom I was hoping it was just

644
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,100
a serious one off

645
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,500
and then it wouldn't happen again but

646
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
now it's happened seven or eight times.

647
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,500
But because of my experience with time

648
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,600
I continue to represent other

649
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
whistleblowers who have been charged under

650
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
the Espionage

651
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,500
Act and continue

652
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,800
Did you so today.

653
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,600
By insisting in the

654
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,700
production

655
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,700
of an enforcement mechanism

656
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,300
I would say jury trials.

657
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
And jury trials

658
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,700
so people can see where it goes until

659
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,700
now and these are all in ministry

660
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,000
they have a process

661
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,100
for quite

662
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,700
a real.

663
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:47,900
My suggestion.
